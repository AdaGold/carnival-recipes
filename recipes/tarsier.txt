Jasmine's Mac-n-Cheese Pizza
--------------------------

Time: 1 hour 15 minutes

1/2 pound dried rotini pasta
Olive oil cooking spray
6 slices thick-cut good quality bacon
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
Pinch ground nutmeg
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 clove garlic, finely chopped
1/2 cup Parmesan

Directions:
3. Drain and spray with olive oil cooking spray, making sure the noodles are coated well. Set aside.
8. Continue to cook until you have a blond roux, about 5 minutes.
6. Season the vegetables with salt and pepper and saute until the onions wilt and become translucent, about 4 minutes.
7. Reduce the heat to medium-low and sprinkle in the flour, stirring to coat the onions and garlic.
10. Crumble the bacon and add half to the sauce. Mix in the Cheddar and mozzarella.
9. Whisk in the milk until you have a thick enough sauce that it coats the back of a spoon.
13. Take the rest of the crumbled bacon and add it to the bowl, stirring well to combine.
5. Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon drippings and add the butter. Add the onions, garlic and nutmeg.
15. Remove from the oven and set down. Spread the macaroni and cheese on the pizza, being careful to leave a 1-inch border.
