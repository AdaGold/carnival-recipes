Jasmine's Mac-n-Cheese Pizza
--------------------------
Servings: 8

Ingredients:
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 cups grated sharp Cheddar
1/2 pound dried rotini pasta
Olive oil cooking spray
6 slices thick-cut good quality bacon
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 cup panko breadcrumbs
1 tablespoon olive oil

Directions:
3. Drain and spray with olive oil cooking spray, making sure the noodles are coated well. Set aside.
4. In a large saute pan over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate.
8. Continue to cook until you have a blond roux, about 5 minutes.
9. Whisk in the milk until you have a thick enough sauce that it coats the back of a spoon.
11. Turn the heat to low. Add the pasta to the cheese sauce and stir to coat. Cover and keep warm.
12. In a small bowl, add the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, chives and olive oil.
13. Take the rest of the crumbled bacon and add it to the bowl, stirring well to combine.
