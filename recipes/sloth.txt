Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------
Time: 4 hours
Servings: 24

Ingredients:
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup warm water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 teaspoon salt


1. Mix together yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1/4 cup flour, and 1/4 cup warm water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes.
2. Mix in 1/2 cup warm water, flour, salt, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vegetable oil.
3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
7. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square. Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes.
10. Transfer as many buns on wax paper as will comfortably fit onto steam-plate leaving 1 to 2 inches between the buns. At least 2 inches space should be left between steam-plate and the wok.

11. Cover wok with lid and steam buns over boiling water for 15 minutes.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
13. Continue steaming batches of buns until all are cooked.
