Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------

1 teaspoon white sugar
1/2 cup warm water

5. Sprinkle baking powder evenly on surface, and knead for 5 minutes.
7. Shape each part into a ball with smooth surface up. Put each ball on a wax paper square. Let stand covered until double, about 30 minutes.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
