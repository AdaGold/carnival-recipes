Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------

1 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 medium yellow bell pepper
1/2 Tbsp dried oregano

2. Cook over medium heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked through at this point.
5. Let them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.
