Audrey's Meatloaf
--------------

Servings: 8

1/4 teaspoon Seasoned Salt
1-1/2 cup Ketchup
1 teaspoon Dry Mustard
1 cup Whole Milk
Tabasco To Taste
6 slices White Bread
Freshly Ground Black Pepper
1/3 cup Brown Sugar
3/4 teaspoons Salt
4 whole Eggs, Beaten
1 cup (heaping) Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese
1/3 cup Minced Flat-leaf Parsley
2 pounds Ground Beef
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon


Time: 1 hour

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Pour milk over the bread slices. Allow it to soak in for several minutes.
4. With clean hands, mix the ingredients until well combined.
3. Place the ground beef, milk-soaked bread, Parmesan, seasoned salt, salt, black pepper, and parsley in a large mixing bowl. Pour in beaten eggs.
5. Form the mixture into a loaf shape on a broiler pan, which will allow the fat to drain.
6. Line the bottom of the pan with foil to avoid a big mess!
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
8. Make the sauce: add ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and hot sauce in a mixing bowl. Stir together.
9. Pour 1/3 of the mixture over the top of the bacon. Spread with a spoon.
10. Bake for 45 minutes, then pour another 1/3 of the sauce over the top. Bake for another 15 minutes.
11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
